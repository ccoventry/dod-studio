//! Says *where* the game died, in the DLL's own log.
//!
//! GoldSrc installs its own unhandled-exception filter and exits quietly, so a
//! crash inside `client.dll` leaves nothing behind: no Windows Error Reporting
//! record, no Application event-log entry, no dump. That makes a crash while
//! testing a hook almost unfalsifiable — "it crashed" is the whole of the
//! evidence, and the interesting question (whose code, at what offset) is the
//! part that is missing.
//!
//! A *vectored* handler runs before any frame-based one, so it sees the fault
//! first-chance — before the engine's filter can swallow it. It only reads and
//! logs: it always returns `EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH`, so the process behaves
//! exactly as it would have. This is a recorder, not a recovery mechanism.
//!
//! Addresses are resolved to `module+RVA` through `VirtualQuery`, because a raw
//! address is worthless after the fact — modules land wherever the loader put
//! them that session, and an RVA is what a disassembler can be pointed at.
